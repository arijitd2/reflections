This my reflection on the on integration of Maven, Jenkinks, TestNG and Selenium.

1. Maven is built-in to Eclipse.
2. TestNG needs to be added as library in Eclipse.
3. Selenium Webdriver jar files again needs to be added as external library
4. All of the above can be managed with POM.xml file as dependencies.
5. Jenkins server is used to scheduled the build jobs.
6. Github is used as the repository and any changes in the repo can trigger a build.
7. Git is local repository
