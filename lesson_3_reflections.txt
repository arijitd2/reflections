Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:When I am collaborating with other developers or have files saved on cloud as backup for my local repo.
Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: One reason could be I am offline and github doesn't know about it. Other could be I am making some changes locally that I don't want to commit yet. It may cause conflicts.
