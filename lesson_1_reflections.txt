A:The diff commands helps to find out the differences between two files line by line.
Q:How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?
Ans: A programmer codes and makes changes to it all the time, that's how he tests the 
new features or bug fixes. He may get it wrong many a time, so needs to get back to an 
old version of the file to see what was done on that particular feature. If he finds a 
mistake he can rectify the issue by adding or deleting contents of the file. He needs to 
keep track of most of the changes he has made over time.
Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A: Pros of manually choosing - a) Commits are made after each logical change. Cons - May miss 
some of the changes made if the developer is forgetful.
Q:Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: Each feature may require to update many files, so it makes sense to save multiple files 
together in one single commit that can be traced back if required.
Q:How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Each commit is stored with a SHA number (the ID of the commit). git log displays the id of 
each commit. git diff displays line by line the difference if any in the two commits.
Q:How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could 
break something?
A: Now I am less worried about making changes, as git keeping a tab on all the commits made.
Q:Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: I have enrolled for DLND of Udacity, will keep my projects version controlled.
